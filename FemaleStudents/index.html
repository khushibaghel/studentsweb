                Why IIT Mandi is ideal for girl students? Over the years it has
                been noticed that the number of girls opting for professional
                and technical education is on the rise, which has been most
                significant for India's march towards attaining the status of a
                holistically developed nation. The fruition of such interest
                have already started coming in with a girl candidate being the
                national topper in IIT advanced exam. In this awakening and also
                the pursuit of the Nation, IIT Mandi also takes pride in having
                some special offerings for the potential admission seeking girl
                candidates in addition to its unique location with very pristine
                and safe social surrounding along with the standards of
                education of IIT system. Mandi is a small town in the hills of
                Himalyas with a rich, peaceful, yet vibrant culture with mostly
                God fearing religious social set up. It is an ideal town and a
                safe home away from home. Additionally, IIT Mandi's unique
                curriculum with emphasis on hands on activities, project based
                learning and opportunities to do socially relevant technical
                courses/projects providing a platform for the girl students to
                outshine others by using their technical skills along with their
                natural skills of having sensitivity towards societal problems.
                As part of the curriculum, students do a course on reverse
                engineering in their first year itself, followed by design
                practicum in second year where teams of interdisciplinary nature
                come up with a product for solving some of the problem. In their
                third year they do interdisciplinary socio technical practicum
                where the students interact with various sections of the
                society, be it District Administration, NGOs, Hospitals,
                Schools, Colleges, Local people etc. to understand what are the
                various problems which can be solved with the help of available
                technology. This is an enriching experience and sensitize
                students towards the needs of society. IIT Mandi partner with
                the global studies program of WPI, Massachusetts, USA and host
                WPI students who participate in our third year socio technical
                practicum. In the fourth year of their B. Tech., students do a
                complete highly technical or research based B.Tech. project. IIT
                Mandi had its first placement session and being Faculty Advisor
                for the placements, I observed that the girls were the first one
                to get the job offers as well as higher study offers. We had
                about 85% overall placement with highest package being offered
                as 18 Lakhs pa, the placement for the girls is 100%. In fact,
                from the next batch also the girls have fetched internship in
                good companies. I believe that IIT Mandi is an ideal place for
                girl students to prosper in the field of their interest and look
                forward to see good number of girls in the upcoming batch 2013.

              <p>
                I am currently pursuing my 4th semester of B.Tech. in Electrical
                Engineering in IIT Mandi and still every morning I am a newborn
                amidst the range of mountains, crowning fluffy white clouds and
                the Uhl river flowing through the feet of these mountains. My
                first experience of these mighty mountains, this excited river
                and those puffy white clouds was some sort of a heavenly
                daydream. Throughout my way to the campus, this mesmerizing
                sight was getting more and more magical. Then, I found the very
                welcoming team of my seniors of Guidance and Counseling Services
                (GCS). They escorted me to my hostel. This was my first time to
                the hostel life , so I was very scared about this new challenge.
                Then, we had interaction with our Director. He was so welcoming.
                We even had our snacks with him. The next day started the 5 Week
                Induction Program with the morning exercises. 5WIP is the
                fanciest part of this journey. After 5WIP, we were introduced to
                the course curriculum. Even today, we can approach our seniors
                anytime (yes, there is no form of ragging). Sometimes, even now,
                our Director comes to our mess to have meal with us and talk
                about our life and career choices, our learning experiences.
                Today when I look back, I find myself more developed, more
                socialised and less occupied with that 5 inch screen. That couch
                potato can now run for 2 and half kilometers. I owe you IIT
                Mandi.

                My name is Kalyani Kumari and I am pursing B.tech (CSE) in IIT
                Mandi . And I am going to share my experiences of IIT Mandi. IIT
                Mandi (Himachal Pradesh) located in laps of Himalayas and
                surrounded by beauty of natures. It is on the bank of river
                Beas. Mandi is best place for hiking and trekking loving people
                and also for nature loving people. Students come here to
                complete their education leaving their home and family. But
                here, I almost never missed my family because seniors and batch
                mates are very helpful and friendly. Seniors provides guidance
                to their juniors in every perspective manner. Faculty members
                are also very good and helpful. With such an environment you
                will never feel alone here. There are many things to do here.
                You will never feel bore. There are many clubs that you can join
                and learn many things. I joined shutterbugs (photography club)
                and S.T.A.C (astro club) and there are much more than these.
                There are many events that celebrated here time to time and you
                will get a better experience from these events. And you will get
                inspired by seniors and alumni of IIT Mandi. Regrading girls
                also this place is very good. Hostels and its environment are
                good. Safety measures and solution of problems are solved by
                care takers as quickly as possible. Girls are safe in IIT Mandi.
                So, over and all IIT Mandi is good place for girls as well as
                for any student who want to purse B.tech degree from an IIT.
